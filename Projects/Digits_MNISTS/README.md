**Project: Handwritten Digit Classification with PyTorch**

This project explores the application of neural networks, specifically using the PyTorch framework, to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

**1. Setting Up the Environment and Loading Data**

* **Goal:** Prepare the necessary tools (PyTorch, Torchvision) and load the MNIST dataset.
* **Process:**
    * Import PyTorch and Torchvision modules.
    * Determine the appropriate device for computation (GPU/CUDA if available, else CPU).
    * Download the MNIST dataset using `torchvision.datasets.MNIST`.
    * Apply transformations:
        * `ToTensor` converts images to PyTorch tensors.
        * `Lambda` performs one-hot encoding on the labels.

**2. Creating a Custom Dataset and DataLoader**

* **Goal:** Structure the data into a format suitable for PyTorch training and batching.
* **Process:**
    * Create a custom `MNISTDataset` class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`:
        * Defines methods `__len__` (number of samples) and `__getitem__` (how to retrieve a single sample).
        * Applies transformations to images and labels.
    * Create `DataLoader` instances for both training and testing data:
        * Enables batching and shuffling of data.

**3. Defining the Neural Network Model**

* **Goal:** Construct a neural network architecture for digit classification.
* **Process:**
    * Create a class `MNISTNeuralNetwork` inheriting from `nn.Module`.
    * Define layers:
        * `Flatten`: Flattens the 28x28 image into a 784-dimensional vector.
        * `nn.Sequential`: A sequence of linear layers with ReLU activation functions.
            * The final layer has 10 output units for the 10 digit classes.
    * Implement the `forward` method to describe how data flows through the network.

**4. Training and Evaluation**

* **Goal:** Train the neural network on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.
* **Process:**
    * Set hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs).
    * Define the loss function (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) and optimizer (`torch.optim.Adam`).
    * Implement training and testing loops:
        * **Training Loop:**
            * Iterate over batches of training data.
            * Perform forward pass, calculate loss, and backpropagate.
            * Update model weights using the optimizer.
            * Log training loss periodically.
        * **Testing Loop:**
            * Iterate over batches of test data.
            * Make predictions and calculate accuracy.
            * Report test accuracy and loss.
    * (Optional) Use TensorBoard to visualize training progress, model architecture, embeddings, precision-recall curves, etc.

**Key Takeaways**

* **PyTorch Basics:**  How to define datasets, dataloaders, and neural network models.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Implementing training and testing loops, using loss functions and optimizers.
* **TensorBoard:** (Optional) Visualizing training progress and model behavior.
* **MNIST Classification:** A classic example of image classification using neural networks.
