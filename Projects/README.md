1. **Car Detection using HOG Features and SVM**

This project demonstrates the use of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect cars in images. It includes:

* **HOG Feature Exploration:**  Visualization of HOG features for car and non-car images to understand their representation.
* **SVM Training and Evaluation:** Training an SVM classifier on HOG features, assessing its performance, and saving the model.
* **Car Detection with Sliding Window:**  Implementation of a sliding window search to locate cars in new images, using the trained SVM model.
* **Image Pyramid and Overlapping Box Reduction:**  Enhancements to improve detection by searching at multiple scales and merging overlapping detections.

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of traditional computer vision techniques combined with machine learning for object detection tasks.
