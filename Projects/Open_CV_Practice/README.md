**Project: Exploring Image Transformations and Object Detection with HOG & SVM**

This project focuses on foundational image processing techniques, feature extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and object detection using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

**Part 1: Image Transformations**

1. **Resizing:**
   - Loaded an image using `cv2.imread()`.
   - Resized the image to half its original size using `cv2.resize()`.
   - Experimented with different interpolation methods (`cv2.INTER_AREA`, `cv2.INTER_LINEAR`) when resizing to observe the differences in image quality.

2. **Cropping:**
   - Selected a specific region of interest within the original image.
   - Created a cropped version of the image by slicing the NumPy array.

3. **Flipping:**
   - Used `cv2.flip()` to generate horizontally and vertically flipped versions of an image.
   - Explored different `flipCode` values to control the flipping direction.

4. **Rotation:**
   - Calculated a rotation matrix using `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D()`, specifying the center point, rotation angle (45 degrees), and scaling factor (1 to maintain size).
   - Applied the rotation to the image using `cv2.warpAffine()`.

5. **Color Conversion:**
   - Converted a color image to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor()`.
   - Observed the differences between the original color and grayscale representations.

6. **HSV Color Space Exploration:**
   - Converted the color image to the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space using `cv2.cvtColor()`.
   - Visualized the HSV image to understand the distribution of hue, saturation, and value components.

**Part 2: Feature Detection and Object Detection with HOG & SVM**

1. **Gradient Calculation:**
   - Used Sobel filters to compute horizontal (`sobelx`) and vertical (`sobely`) gradients in a test image.
   - Calculated the gradient magnitude to highlight areas of significant intensity change (potential edges).
   - Experimented with alternative gradient operators like Roberts and Prewitt.

2. **Canny Edge Detection:**
   - Applied Gaussian blurring to reduce noise in an image.
   - Used the Canny edge detector to identify edges in the blurred image.

3. **License Plate Detection (HOG & SVM):**
   - **Data Collection:** Gathered positive images (containing license plates) and negative images (not containing license plates).
   - **HOG Feature Calculation:** Computed HOG descriptors for all images using a `cv2.HOGDescriptor` object with specific parameters.
   - **SVM Training:** Trained a linear SVM classifier to distinguish between license plate and non-license plate HOG features.
   - **Sliding Window Detection:** Implemented a sliding window approach to search for license plates in a test image.
   - **Prediction and Visualization:** Used the SVM model to make predictions on HOG features extracted from each window, drawing bounding boxes around potential license plate detections.

**Key Takeaways:**

This project encompasses fundamental concepts in image processing (resizing, cropping, flipping, rotation), color space conversions (RGB to grayscale, RGB to HSV), gradient calculation, edge detection (Sobel, Canny), feature extraction (HOG), and object detection using an SVM classifier. It provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying computer vision techniques to real-world problems.
