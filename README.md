# Machine Learning Portfolio: From Software Engineer to Machine Learning Engineer

During my time as a Google Software Engineer on the Assistant team, I developed a keen interest in the machine learning technologies powering modern applications. After being laid off during parental leave, I seized the opportunity to dive deep into Machine Learning while balancing childcare responsibilities.

This portfolio represents my journey from a beginner to a capable Machine Learning Engineer. I've focused on building a strong foundation in theory and applying my knowledge to diverse projects, with a particular emphasis on computer vision.

## Key Skills:

* **Core ML:** Python, scikit-learn, neural networks (CNNs, RNNs), object detection, image segmentation
* **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS
* **Tools:** ChatGPT-4, Gemini Pro (utilized for learning support and code debugging)
* **Projects:** Experience across diverse areas including image classification, object detection, autonomous navigation, and fine-tuning pre-trained models.
* **Programming Languages:** Python, Kotlin, Java, C/C++

## Project Highlights:

1. **Car_Image_Detection:** Implemented a car detection system using HOG features and SVM classification.
2. **Digits_MNISTS:** Built and trained a PyTorch neural network for accurate digit classification on the MNIST dataset.
3. **Kal_And_Jinse_Identification:** Fine-tuned a Mask R-CNN model to distinguish between my two dogs, showcasing model adaptation for specific tasks.
4. **Open_CV_Practice:** Explored fundamental image processing techniques (transformations, gradient calculations, edge detection) and HOG-based object detection.
5. **RC_Drivable_Space (In Progress):** Developed an autonomous line-following robot with next steps adding drivable terrain detection using neural networks to drive without the line.
6. **TorchVIsion_Fine_Tuning:** Fine-tuned a Mask R-CNN model to detect and segment pedestrians, demonstrating proficiency in advanced deep learning techniques.
7. **RobotArm:** This project develops a robotic arm using ROS, machine learning, and an Android app to identify and sort different shaped blocks into corresponding holes, aiming to create an educational tool while enhancing robotics expertise.

## Learning Journey:

* Self-guided learning using "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" (Aurélien Géron).
* Leveraged large language models (ChatGPT, Gemini Pro) to accelerate learning and problem-solving.
* Utilized online tutorials anda other online ML communities pages like Kaggle and Reddit.
* Currently enrolled in Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning Specialization" to deepen my understanding of ML algorithms and mathematical foundations.
