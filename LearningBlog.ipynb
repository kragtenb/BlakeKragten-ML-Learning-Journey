    "## Building CNN & Allowing The RC Car To See The Environment\n",
    "### 3/25:\n",
    "Researched using Chat4 how to setup CNN for my use case and with using pytorch.\n",
    "Started by adding capturing picture functionality to my KeyboardControl script for the car.\n",
    "Took pictures with the car around the house to get some training data to allow the car to decide what is drivable places and what are objects and walls.\n",
    "Started down the path of doing a binary classifier and used Makesense.ai to use rectangular boxes to determine what objects are. \n",
    "After working on labeling the data, I came to the conclusion that a binary classifier is the not right solution for the problem. Yes it could give me a confidence of the entire picture if it is drivable or not but it doesn’t really give me any information on where the car can drive.\n",
    "I switched to using semantic segmentation for my solution and started up CVAT to segment my training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3/27:\n",
    "Using CVAT to label areas in my image as drivable, obstacles and walls.\n",
    "Labeling takes a long time….\n",
    "Finished labeling for the first time. Looking to now make my data set and train my model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During this time I was setting up my new PC with a new CPU and graphics card so I can do LLMs and Model Training locally. I ran into a lot of issues getting my AMD graphics card to be detected by linux and Pytorch. Took a day or so to figure out the issues but luckily AMD just set a repo to pytorch using ROCm so I was able to get this all working.\n",
    "### 4/1-4/2:\n",
    "Add initial model training for semantic segmentation. Model is not performing as expected.                                 \n",
    "After training the model basically predicts all pixels are basically drivable.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried the deeplab neural net and the fully connected network and still getting the same issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently not understanding how to improve and move forward so I think I will try to do an object detection model          \n",
    "first. This seems like an easier problem than my current project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4/3-4/4:\n",
    "After struggling to understand how to modify my CNN, I decided to take a step back from the projects and understand the underlying code and concepts a bit more. I decided to create a training plan to understand more fully base concepts like numpy, pandas, opencv, edge detection concepts and much more. Then after having a better understanding I will move back to trying to get the bot working.\n",

    "2. Take the HOG descriptors generated using training data of cars and format it to be ready for training\n",
    "3. Take the data and train a SVM classifer with the descriptors\n",

    "### Notes & learnings\n",
    "* SVM stands for Support Vector Machine which is a classifer machine learning model.\n",
    "* SVM groups items based on a drawing line that can be a linear or curved 'rbf kernel'. What ever is on one side of the line would classified as one class and on the other would be another class\n",
    "* SVM will be trained on labeled data to allow the model to learn what class is what.\n",
    "* HOG \"Histogram of oriented gradients\" calculates gradiates and looks for edges then provide the direction that the gradient is going. Then classifies it into a histogram of all direction vectors.\n",
    "* Sobel operator which is usually a 3x3 matrix with one side of the matrix looking to multiple by -1, 0 in the center and 1 on the other side. This is done for veritcal as well. this will figure out the flow of the gradient.\n",
    "* Image will be devided into cell size of 8x8 (customizable)\n",
    "* Each pixel will have the calcualted gradiant magnitude and direction provided by sobel operators\n",
    "* The histogram bins in hog represents the angle of the direction \n",
    "* If we picked 9 for nbins in HOG for an unsigned angle then we would get bins every 20 degrees\n",
    "* Each pixel in the cell (64 in this case) will add their votes to the specific bins given there magnitude and direction of the vector\n",
    "* Adding code in file to view the HOG data of a car image\n",
    "* Switched to using skilearn as it provides the HOG gradient image in its API.\n",
    "* Model has 99% accuracy using SVM rbf and C of 10. Could look to optimize further but is sufficient for the use case.\n",
    "* Moving to implementing the sliding window that will loop through different size images throughout the image to determine if there is a car"
