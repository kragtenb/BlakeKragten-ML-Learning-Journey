(Work In Progress) BlakeKragten-ML-Learning-Journey ü§ñüöóüê∂
Welcome to my Machine Learning (ML) journey! This repository showcases my hands-on
exploration of ML concepts and my transition from a Software Engineer at Google to an
aspiring Machine Learning Engineer.

üìñ My Journey into Machine Learning:
My foray into the world of machine learning began during my tenure as a Software Engineer
at Google, where I worked on the Google Assistant project. While I was intrigued by the 
underlying ML technology, my understanding remained limited. Upon being laid off during 
my parental leave, I resolved to leverage this newfound time to delve deeper into the 
field while taking care of my daughter.

My journey started with "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & 
TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron, a resource recommended through various online communities.
These initial steps provided a solid foundation in Python, scikit-learn, 
and the fundamental concepts of neural networks.
To further enhance my comprehension, I actively sought the guidance 
of large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini Pro, which proved invaluable in 
clarifying complex topics and debugging code.

Eager to apply my newfound knowledge, I embarked on a personal project: building a 
Raspberry Pi-powered RC car. Initially, I utilized OpenCV to implement line-following 
capabilities, leveraging techniques such as color thresholding and contour detection. As 
my confidence grew, I ventured into deep learning, aiming to enable the car to navigate 
autonomously within my home. However, this ambitious endeavor underscored the intricacies 
of deep neural networks, as my initial model failed to perform as expected. This setback 
prompted me to revisit core concepts and reinforce my understanding through tutorials and 
exercises.

During this period, I gained proficiency in object detection using HOG features and 
sliding window techniques, and I experimented with PyTorch and TensorFlow for image 
classification tasks on datasets like MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. I also successfully fine-
tuned a CNN model to recognize my two dogs, showcasing my ability to adapt deep learning 
models for specific use cases.

Throughout my learning journey, I have continuously sought opportunities to deepen my 
theoretical understanding while applying my skills to practical projects. My ongoing 
pursuit of knowledge is evident in my current progress through Andrew Ng's "Machine 
Learning Specialization," which has significantly illuminated the mathematical 
underpinnings of ML algorithms.

I am excited to continue expanding my expertise in machine learning and eager to 
contribute my skills to a collaborative team environment. Please feel free to explore my 
code, projects, and learning resources, and do not hesitate to reach out if you have any 
questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities.
