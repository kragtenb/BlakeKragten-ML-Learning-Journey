(Work In Progress) BlakeKragten-ML-Learning-Journey 🤖🚗🐶
Welcome to my Machine Learning (ML) journey! This repository showcases my hands-on exploration of ML concepts and my transition from a Software Engineer at Google to an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer.

📖 My Story
During my time at Google working on Google Assistant, I was fascinated by machine learning.  After a layoff, I embraced this opportunity to dive deeper into the field. I began by reading "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron and completing the Coursera "Machine Learning Specialization" while utilizing LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini Pro as valuable learning companions.

📂 What You'll Find Here
projects: The heart of my learning! Here you'll find:
rc_car: A Raspberry Pi-powered RC car project that evolved from basic movements to a line-following robot using OpenCV, and an attempt at semantic segmentation for autonomous navigation.
dog_identifier: A CNN model fine-tuned to recognize my two dogs, Kal and Jinse, by name (check out the webcam demo video!).
...: Other projects demonstrating image classification, object detection, and more.
tutorials_learning: Exercises and code from tutorials, courses, and the books I've studied.
Blake_Kragten_Resume.pdf: My latest resume, outlining my skills and experience.
🚀 Key Technologies & Skills
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Android, Bluetooth Low Energy, 5G, SQL, Git

🎯 Learning Highlights
Traditional Computer Vision: Applied OpenCV to create a line-following robot and object detection models.
Deep Learning: Experimented with CNNs for image classification, semantic segmentation, and fine-tuning for custom tasks.
Coursera Specialization: Deepened my understanding of ML algorithms and mathematical foundations through Andrew Ng's courses.
